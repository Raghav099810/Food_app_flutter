## ðŸ§ª Testing Workflow

This app uses **BLoC architecture**. The test structure is organized by layer:

| Layer       | Whatâ€™s tested                                                     | Example test case                                                                 |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bloc        | States emitted correctly given certain events                    | `RestaurantBloc`: on `FetchRestaurantsEvent` â†’ emits `Loading`, then `Loaded`     |
| Repository  | Data returns list of restaurants / menus, handles errors         | `RestaurantRepository.getRestaurantList()` returns valid list; errors are caught  |
| UI / Widget | UI responds to bloc states                                       | Loading shows progress, loaded shows list, error shows error message              |
| Integration | Full flow: select restaurant â†’ view menu â†’ add to cart â†’ checkout | Navigating through app updates UI and BLoC states accordingly                     |
